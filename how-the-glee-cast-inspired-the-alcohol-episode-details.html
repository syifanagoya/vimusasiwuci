<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>How the Glee Cast Inspired the Alcohol Episode: Details</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Kevin McHale</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jenna Ushkowitz</strong></a> confessed that the iconic drunk episode of <a href=#>Glee</a> was inspired by one of the cast’s on-set shenanigans.</p><p>“We got caught having a dance party at base camp — where our trailers are — after going to lunch and having a little bit of some substances,” Ushkowitz, 37, recalled on the Monday, July 31, episode of the “<a href=#>And That’s What You REALLY Missed</a>” podcast. “And by substances I mean sake.”</p><p>McHale, 35, remembered that the cast decided to go to a nearby sushi spot, and one of their costars instigated the boozy lunch.</p><p>“We went out, and I won’t name names. There was one person who was the ringleader. It wasn’t either of us … [they] started pushing us all to drink,” he confessed. “And we’re like ‘I don’t know if we should.’ Some of us partook more than others.”</p><p>Both McHale and Ushkowitz teased that neither of them <a href=#>got too intoxicated</a> during lunch. However, they did reveal that the “ringleader” and some of the other cast members ended up going into others’ trailers and <a href=#>doodling on the walls</a> with permanent markers. Ushkowitz was “very upset” that her trailer was one of the victims.</p><p>“Then the producers came down and they partook in our dance party … but then went back and snitched on us and we got in trouble,” Ushkowitz said. “And they wrote an episode about it”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glee-Kevin-McHale-and-Jenna-Ushkowitz-Says-Cast-Inspired-Drunk-Episode.jpg><p>The incident inspired the season 2 episode, “Blame It on the Alcohol,” which focuses on underage drinking. The Glee club was enlisted to perform at an <a href=#>anti-alcohol</a> assembly, but the students showed up to their performance intoxicated. “We got drunk on set y’all, that’s why,” McHale quipped.</p><p>In the episode, <a href=#><strong>Lea Michele</strong></a>’s character throws a house party for the glee club while her parents are out of town. The group gets drunk, does some karaoke and plays a game of spin-the-bottle (A game the cast also <a href=#>played offscreen</a>.)</p><p>Some of the character’s drunken moments were inspired by their real-life mannerisms including Ushkowitz’s “cackle” and McHale trying on women’s clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Glee-Kevin-McHale-and-Jenna-Ushkowitz-Says-Cast-Inspired-Drunk-Episode-2.jpg><p>“There were a lot of our ‘isms’ in this entire thing. Where Santana [<a href=#>Naya Rivera</a>] mouths ‘Kiss me’ … she’s sort of making fun of herself,” McHale said. “We’re making fun of each other in all of this.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ushkowitz pointed out that Rivera saying “No me gusta” was very much like herself while McHale noted that Michele, 36, calling out for “cheers” repeatedly was also very accurate.</p><p>While the episode’s inspiration stemmed as an on-set consequence, both McHale and Ushkowitz agreed that filming the house party scene was one of the “funnest” things they got to do on set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12ptaZ5xqWcnmWTlsC1ecinqqmhopqxbsDHnmSapJOktbC4jJ6noqufmbJusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-hudson-heartbreaking-family-tribute-touching-post.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Hudson shares heartbreaking family tribute in touching post</span></a>
