Is Martie Allen married?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>When people haven’t heard the latest news about their favorite personalities, they become curious about what happened to them.</p><p>Some sadly pass away, some continue to do what they do best, while others simply move on and drop out of the spotlight.</p><p>Some personalities only manage to achieve the spotlight because of their relationships.</p><p>Martie Allen is one such personality whose life people would love to know more about.</p><p>So, let’s find out what happened to Martie Allen and what she might be doing now.</p><h2><strong>The Origin&nbsp; Story</strong></h2><p>Like many celebrities, Martie Allen was thrust into the spotlight due to her relationship with a celebrity.</p><p>In this case, said celebrity is none other than retired comedian, singer, and actress Christina (Kristy) McNichol.</p><p>Martie Allen was born on 1st January 1960 in the United States, and that’s pretty much all we know about her early life before she became famous.</p><p>Allen is very private and does not even have a public social media presence.</p><p>Allen likes to keep her professional life under wraps, but we know she attempted to break into the film industry but could not make headway due to unknown circumstances.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to her partner McNichols, who made significant contributions to the entertainment industry throughout her career.</p><h2><strong>Martie Allen and Kristy McNichol’s relationship</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51042 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-Kristy-McNichol-relationship.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-Kristy-McNichol-relationship.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51042 class=wp-caption-text>Kristy McNichol – @Getty</p><p>Martie and Kristy first became serious about their relationship in 1991, after they had likely been dating on and off for a few years.</p><p>The pair shared a photo of themselves together with People Magazine, and it wasn’t long before the entertainment industry was abuzz with the news. Still, they were together for quite some time before announcing their relationship in 2012.</p><p>The loving couple has reportedly stated that their successful long-term relationship is due to them being themselves and accepting each other as they are.</p><p>Kristy McNichol is a famous personality who retired from acting due to mental health issues.</p><p>Before that fateful day, though, she was a prolific actor who started very young and managed to have a decades-long career before leaving show business for good in 2001.</p><p>Kristy and Allen were inspired to come out because they were concerned about homophobic bullying, which had grown to endemic proportions in the States.</p><p>As she approached the golden age of 50, she and Allen decided it was time to be open about who they were. In 2010 and onwards, suicides among gay and lesbian teens had spiked to unprecedented levels, so the pair thought their openness would bring some hope to troubled young people.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Laura G Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>The love of Martie Allen’s life – Kristy McNichol</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51043 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-spouse-of-Kristy-McNichol.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-spouse-of-Kristy-McNichol.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51043 class=wp-caption-text>Kristy McNichol – @Getty</p><p>The love of Martie Allen’s life, Kristy McNichol, was born on 11 September 1962 in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Her father, James McNichol, was a carpenter.</p><p>Her mother was Carolyn McNichol, and she has a brother named James (Jimmy) McNichol.</p><p>We don’t know much about Kristy’s Mom,&nbsp; but Kristy’s father left soon after Jimmy was born, and her mother raised her kids on her own while working several different jobs.</p><p>Jimmy is a star in his own right.</p><p>Along with being a teen heartthrob and starring in numerous television and movie roles, he is also a co-partner of Playground Television, an entertainment production company.</p><p>Kristy started her career through guest appearances in shows like Starsky and Hutch, The Bionic Woman, Love, American Style, and the Love Boat.
