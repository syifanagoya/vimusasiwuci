But a lot more went on than sing-a-longs and shenanigans.</p><p>The group of guys had just finished up a dance-off while cruising through LA when they spotted a women frantically running out of her house. Apparently, her child&nbsp;had stopped breathing, and she didn’t know what to do to help the baby. Everyone ran across the street to see what was going on, but it was band member Anthony Kiedis that jumped into action.</p><p>“The baby was not breathing, and I thought, ‘I’m gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid.'”</p><p>The baby’s mouth was locked shut, so Anthony&nbsp;started rubbing the&nbsp;belly to see if that would help. Eventually, the baby’s&nbsp;mouth began to bubble, and the&nbsp;eyes rolled back into place. Minutes later an ambulance arrived and rushed the baby and the mother to the hospital for further care.</p><p>And what did Anthony, the band, and James do after that? Well, they hopped back in to the car to finish up the segment, of course.&nbsp;All in a day’s work.</p><p>You can watch the video of the bands appearance on Carpool Karaoke below. Make sure you keep an eye out and let&nbsp;us know if you can spot any hints that&nbsp;one of the guys in that car just performed a pretty heroic act.&nbsp;If you can, leave us a comment or tweet us at <a href=#>@CelebMix!</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51krq%2FAx6ilsmWbnrKltdJmqZ6cXZ28tXnCoaCloV2lsrG8xKuqZquRq7KlecGambKrXaG2p7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mckenzie-morales.html><span>←</span><span>McKenzie Morales- Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating</span></a>
