For this reason, once they stop being Cameron Dennis’ employees, Donna and Harvey share a romantic evening, presumably&nbsp;covered in whipped cream.&nbsp;However, during a meal following their encounter, Harvey reveals that Donna is more than welcome to remain his assistant as he takes on his new attorney role. While she is excited about the job opportunity, Donna asserts that there won’t be any more&nbsp;risqué rituals. Harvey then&nbsp;sees a can opener and says they could try something more innocent to celebrate.</p><p dir=ltr>During a 2016 “BUILD Series” interview,&nbsp;Sarah Rafferty noted her surprise after Season 3, Episode 6, confirmed her character and Harvey had been romantic. She stated that she and Gabriel Macht were unaware that their characters had done more than just trade&nbsp;amorous quips. “We both were super surprised when they all of a sudden — what was it, like, season 3, that there was a flashback and you were like, ‘Wait — they what? Huh.’ ‘I wasn’t playing it that way. Were you playing it that way?’ ‘I wasn’t playing it that way.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHsmShmaKrsrp5wKebZpyfo7uiv4ysnJyqlal6pK3NZqapnZ6av26%2ByK2smqRdrK60ec2erZ6qXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nathan-stewart-jarrett.html><span>←</span><span>Nathan Stewart-Jarrett Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
