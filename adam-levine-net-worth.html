His parents, Fredric and Patsy Levine, divorced when Adam was seven. He has described his family as very musical and attributed growing up listening to his mother's idols, Simon & Garfunkle, Fleetwood Mac, and the Beatles, to shaping his unique musical style. Levine went to Brentwood School where he met his future Maroon 5 band members, Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden.</p><h2 id=early-music-career><strong>Early Music Career</strong></h2><p>Levine, Carmichael, Madden, and their friend Ryan Dusick formed a band called Kara's Flowers in February 1994. They played their first gig at Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood in '95, with Levine on vocals and guitar. The band was discovered by producer Tommy Allen at a Malibu beach party where they were performing. Allen and his partner had Kara's Flowers record an 11-track album and they were subsequently signed to reprise records through producer Rob Cavallo. The band released their first album, The Fourth World, in August 1997. That same year, the band also made a guest appearance on Beverly Hills, 90210. After the guys graduated high school, they toured in support of their album, but to little success. After the album only sold about 5,000 copies, Reprise decided to drop the band and Kara's Flowers soon broke up.</p><h2 id=maroon-5><strong>Maroon 5</strong></h2><p>After the band broke up, Levine and Carmichael moved to New York to study at Five Towns College. Eventually, Kara's Flowers decided to get back together with a makeover, adding a fifth member, swapping one out, and renaming themselves Maroon 5. Levine was a writer's assistant on the CBS television show Judging Amy before he hit it big in the music industry. During his time on Judging Amy, Adam wrote several poems and songs about an ex-girlfriend named Jane. These notes would eventually turn into Maroon 5's first smash hit album, 2002's "Songs About Jane" which was certified triple platinum after its release. The album was a sleeper hit, selling 10 million copies and becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2004–two years after its initial release. Maroon 5 won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 2005, and the next year they won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for the album's second single, the insanely popular hit "This Love".</p><p>Since releasing their debut album, Maroon 5 has sold over 30 million albums worldwide, including 10 million in the United States alone. The group has also sold over 30 million digital singles. Maroon 5's albums It Won't Be Soon Before Long in 2007 and V in 2014 both reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's popular singles include "Harder to Breathe", "This Love", "She Will Be Loved", "Sunday Morning", "Makes Me Wonder", "Moves Like Jagger" (featuring Christina Aguilera), "Payphone" (featuring <a href=# title="Wiz Khalifa Net Worth">Wiz Khalifa</a>), "One More Night", "Maps", "Animals", "Sugar", "Don't Wanna Know" (featuring <a href=# title="Kendrick Lamar Net Worth">Kendrick Lamar</a>), and more.</p><p>Maroon 5 continues to record and tour extensively.
