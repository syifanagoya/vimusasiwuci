Lawrence, who wore a burgundy off-the-shoulder Dior top with a matching belt and skirt when gracing the cover, also got candid about how "scary" it can feel to "talk about motherhood" publicly since "it's so different for everybody."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If I say, It was amazing from the start, some people will think, It wasn't amazing for me at first, and feel bad," she shared. "Fortunately, I have so many girlfriends who were honest. Who were like, It's scary. You might not connect right away. You might not fall in love right away. So I felt so prepared to be forgiving."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tina Barney/Vogue</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lawrence added, "I remember walking with one of my best friends at, like, nine months, and being like, Everyone keeps saying that I will love my baby more than my cat. But that's not true. Maybe I'll love him as much as my cat?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress said she was quickly proven wrong, however, when the day she gave birth to baby Cy felt like the start of a whole new chapter. "Like, Now is day one of my life. I just stared," Jennifer explained. "I was just so in love. I also fell in love with all babies everywhere. Newborns are just so amazing. They're these pink, swollen, fragile little survivors. Now I love all babies. Now I hear a baby crying in a restaurant and I'm like, Awwww, preciousssss."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tina Barney/Vogue</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while the star explained that she's not without typical new mother concerns — "My heart has stretched to a capacity that I didn't know about. I include my husband in that. And then they're both just, like, out there — walking around, crossing streets. He's gonna drive one day. He's gonna be a stupid teenager and be behind the wheel of a car. And I'm just gonna be like, Good night! You know? Like, who sleeps?" she shared — Lawrence said experiencing her first child's milestones has been the greatest experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I mean the euphoria of Cy is just — Jesus, it's impossible," Lawrence told the outlet. "I always tell him, 'I love you so much it's impossible.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8mepaehlpq%2FbrjAsKmeppOafKuxzaegn52iYrmiw9GepZydXaeyt7HApZydZZKWr7p5zZqknmWfmMGwrsSrZK%2Bnl6qybrXNrZyrrpmaxA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samurai-warriors-5-trailer-html.html><span>←</span><span>New Samurai Warriors 5 Trailer Reveals The Games Full Cast Of Characters</span></a>
