As her son with husband David Sanov turned 18 in 2023, Days of Our Lives’ Alison Sweeney (Sami) took to Instagram to sing Benjamin’s praises. “Even as a really little kid, he’s always been kind and sincere. As he grew through school,” she said, “we discovered that he’s also smart and thoughtful.
“But my favorite,” she added, “is his fantastic sense of humor — because he likes all the same ’80s comedies as I do!"><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As he grew through school,” she said, “we discovered that he’s also smart and thoughtful.</p><p>“But my favorite,” she added, “is his fantastic sense of humor — because he likes all the same ’80s comedies as I do!&nbsp;We can’t wait to see where he goes from here.”</p><p>Us, either. But while we wait, let’s take a stroll down Memory Lane, why don’t we, and look back at Ben’s whole life… in pictures!</p><h2>Life’s a Beach</h2><p>In the earliest pic we could find, Sweeney and Ben appear to have just completed construction on a couple of especially well-built sand castles. Or would those be sand domes?</p><h2><br>Magic, Indeed</h2><p>By the time time the family paid a visit to Disney World in 2012, Ben’s little sister Megan was on the scene. “Everything in the new Disney Baby Store is just so cute!” exclaimed Mom. “Need it all!”</p><h2><br>Style for Miles</h2><p>In 2013, Ben surprised Sweeney with a haircut that was definitely a cut above. “Love the red!” she said. Us, too. Wonder if we could pull off that look…</p><h2><br>Trick or Treat</h2><p>Megan and Ben must have scored a candy store’s worth of goodies on Halloween 2013. Their Breaking Bad costumes were on point.</p><h2><br>When Ho Ho Ho Meets Ha Ha Ha</h2><p>Ben discovered over the holidays in 2014 that “this elf likes playing tricks,” chuckled Mom. Er, we mean the elf herself.</p><h2><br>Having a Ball</h2><p>In the summer of 2015, the whole family got taken out the ballgame. “Let’s go, Dodgers!” cheered Mom.</p><h2><br>Fashion Police</h2><p>In 2015, Sweeney got Ben to weigh in on the outfit that she wore on the cover of Redbook magazine. That is, she got him to do so after he was done looking at his own picture. (Kids!)</p><h2><br>Up, Up and Away</h2><p>At Christmastime in 2015, Ben joined Mom on “a little holiday canyon hike.” Which we can also count as exercise for ourselves, right? No? Dang.</p><h2><br>Outwit, Outplay, Outstanding!</h2><p>It was an “awesome Mom moment” for Sweeney in 2016 when she got to bring Ben to the live taping of the Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X finale.</p><h2><br>Life in Death Valley</h2><p>As Ben and Megan made tracks across the dunes, Sweeney marveled that there was “nothing better than sharing this incredible planet and all its unique beauty with your kids.”</p><h2><br>Food for Thought</h2><p>“Loving the last days of vaca with the kids,” Sweeney did a little lunchtime “mother/son bonding” with Ben in 2018.</p><h2><br>Like Father, Like Son</h2><p>In 2018, Sweeney shared a handsome photo of her better half and their son in honor of National Police Week.</p><h2><br>Game, Set, Mismatch</h2><p>In 2019, Sweeney had to laugh. Though she recommends you mix up your fitness routine and “try something new…&nbsp;maybe not jump out on a tennis court with your 14-year-old son with some absurd expectation that you can keep up.” She didn’t keep up, then? “Not. Even. Close.”</p><h2><br>Thank God It’s Tuesday</h2><p>How come? Because Tuesdays at the Sweeney/Sanov household are always Taco Tuesdays. Wow, that’s a(n enchi)lada tasty-looking toppings!</p><h2><br>Forecast Calls for Son</h2><p>On National Sons Day in 2020, Sweeney delighted in the fact that hers was “fantastic” and “awesome,” adding, “I am so grateful every day for you, Ben!”</p><h2><br>The Dog Days of Summer</h2><p>In 2021, Ben and his mom somehow managed to get their rescue dogs to sit still long enough to take a heartwarming photo. If that doesn’t set your tail to wagging, we dunno what would!</p><h2><br>Even Without SORAS, They Grow Up So Fast!</h2><p>As Ben turned 17, Mom shared then-and-now pics that left us wondering how he’d grown up… while she hadn’t seemed to age a day. Lovely!</p><h2><br>Game On</h2><p>From the sounds of this 2023 post, Ben still wasn’t able to improve Mom’s tennis game much.</p><h2>The Struggle Is Real… ly Funny</h2><p>It apparently took some work, but it worked. “We tortured Ben to get a good birthday photo,” Sweeney said as Ben turned 18. “Dave asked, ‘Isn’t he too old for balloons?’ I said, ‘Never!!!’”</p><p>On your way to the comments to wish Ben a happy birthday, <strong>check out <a href=# rel=noopener>his sister’s life in pictures</a> here or more photos of <a href=# rel=noopener>soap stars and their kids</a> via the below photo gallery.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19rf3V%2FknFmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BMmqOiq5%2BjerTDxJ6lnrFdqLyvecGepWakmZuybr%2FTqKmyZaSeuqa4yKecZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandro-nones.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandro Nones</span></a>
