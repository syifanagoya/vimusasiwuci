Our top destination? Venice. Such a beautiful, historic and romantic city. Give us the gondola rides! Give us the specialty foods! Give us the photo ops!</p><p>Before we plan out our entire itinerary and hop in a car to the airport, however, we need to figure out <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">what we’re packing</a>! We definitely need some pretty dresses, some comfy pants and a pair of sunglasses, but one of the most important things to bring while traveling is a pair of <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> that can carry you through every last event. For <strong>Kate Bosworth</strong>, it’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this classic Reebok pair</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>G</strong><strong>et the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reebok Lifestyle Classic Leather Sneaker</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$75</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><p>Bosworth recently traveled to Venice to attend the Dolce and Gabbana Alta Moda 2021 show, but she decided to also spend the final week of August enjoying the city with her mom. Over the course of the week, we spotted her in a white pair of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these Reebok sneakers</a> (at least) three times — with three very different outfits. She wore them with a <a href=# rel=noopener>white tank and overalls one day</a>, a <a href=# rel=noopener>D&G patchwork dress another day</a> and with a <a href=# rel=noopener>striped collared shirt and blue jeans another day</a>. If you were wondering about these shoes’ versatility, these outfits are your answer!</p><p>Over 4,000 Zappos reviewers are also on board with these sneakers. One called the style their “go-to shoe for travel,” which it seems Bosworth would agree with. Other reviewers noted how this is the “most comfortable tennis shoe” they’ve ever bought and that their “feet are now happy” since making the switch to Reebok!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reebok Lifestyle Classic Leather Sneaker</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$75</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><p>These sneakers have a leather upper and a low profile with a classic lace-up closure. You’ll find two rows of perforations on the toe box for breathability and all different Reebok logos on the side, heel and tongue of the shoe. Inside is a molded sock liner for “comfort, cushioning and durability,” while below the footbed is an EVA midsole for bouncy support. On the bottom is a rubber outsole with added texture for traction — perfect for any slippery Venice streets!</p><p>Bosworth wore the White/Gum version of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these sneakers</a>, which are still available in most sizes on Zappos (for now), but there are seven other variations you can also check out on the same page if you’d prefer a different look. Grab a white version with a white outsole, or maybe one with colorful accents like aqua or blue and pink. There are also a couple of black versions too if that’s your style — or want a few different styles!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reebok Lifestyle Classic Leather Sneaker</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$75</a> at Zappos with free shipping!</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Not your style?
