Later, Sanders enlisted Edmonds to help develop his reality-TV comeback, "Deion's Family Playbook."&nbsp;And while Edmonds was only supposed to spearhead production, their blossoming romance changed the show's trajectory. "I started off thinking I was just going to produce [the show]," said Edmonds. "But as I started working with Deion on the show, we grew quite fond of each other and ended up dating." According to <a href=#>IMDb</a>, the show, which premiered in 2014, lasted for one season. However, Sanders and Edmonds are still going strong.</p><p>On Valentines Day 2019, Edmonds announced on <a href=#>Instagram</a> that she and Sanders were engaged. However, Sanders later appeared on the&nbsp;<a href=#>"Journeys of Faith"</a> podcast and revealed that he had actually proposed weeks prior. Nearly four years later, Sanders and Edmon have yet to marry. And while extended engagements are increasingly common, Sanders has since revealed why they haven't tied the knot. "I didn't believe in long-distance marriages, number one," he shared, referencing that their careers have kept them apart. However, their dynamic works for them.&nbsp;"I love what both of us contribute to society and to this world," Sanders explained to People.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlnbIZ4f46ipayhlJp6pbHIqKVmq5Gjsaa%2B0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllp57BqXnTq5icnalisqW5zqebrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomezs-kidney-donor-francia-rasa-did-it-out-of-the-kindness-of-my-heart.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Gomezs kidney donor Francia Rasa did it out of the kindness of my heart</span></a>
