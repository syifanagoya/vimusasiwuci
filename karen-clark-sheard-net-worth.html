Her mother is the famed gospel choir director, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. She and her sisters formed the gospel group, The Clark Sisters. The five-member group was not only immensely popular with gospel music fans, but many of their songs also achieved major success on the R&B charts, especially during the 70s and 80s. The group has won two Grammy Awards, and has sold more albums than any other female gospel group ever. Karen Clark Sheard still performs with The Clark Sisters, but she also launched a solo career in 1997. Her first solo album, "Finally Karen", was nominated for a Grammy Award, and reached #28 on the R&B charts, and #2 on the Gospel charts. She has since released four more solo albums, and won a Grammy Award for Songwriting in 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHysrdGepWabnJa%2FrHnSoZyaqpRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selangie-arlene-henriquez-net-worth-183747.html><span>←</span><span>Selangie Arlene Henriquez Net Worth</span></a>
