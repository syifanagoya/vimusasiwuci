Following the collapse of Drexel, Moelis left with a portion of his team to join Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette where he served as head of its corporate finance investment banking division. Under Moelis, DLJ emerged as a prominent investment banking firm in Los Angeles in the 1990s.</p><p>Following the acquisition of DLJ by Credit Suisse First Boston in 2000, Moelis was named head of US investment banking of the combined firm in September 2000. However, his tenure at CSFB would be short, announcing his departure for UBS (then known as UBS Warburg) just months later taking the core of his team with him, including a number that would later join Moelis & Company. Moelis recruited more than 70 senior investment bankers to UBS within three months of his arrival.</p><p>In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately assumed the role of president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited with the build-out of UBS’s investment banking operation in the United States. By the end of 2006, UBS was ranked Top 4 in the global fee pool for the first time.</p><p>Moelis founded Moelis & Company along with several fellow senior UBS investment bankers that included Navid Mahmoodzadegan, Jeff Raich, John Momtazee, Todd Wadler, Elizabeth Crain, and Warren Woo.</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Ken Moelis</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-ken></span><span>Who is Ken?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ken Moelis born Kenneth D.
