The sitcom reminded viewers that all families are complicated — but even the most wild relatives can’t out crazy the Wilkersons."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Her parenting techniques were counteracted by the family patriarch, Hal Wilkerson (<a href=#><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong></a>). Unlike his wife, Hal was <a href=#>a bit passive when disciplining his children</a>. In fact, Hal often started the shenanigans that his sons all took part in on the show.</p><p>Muniz, for his part, <a href=#>brought to life whiz kid Malcolm</a>, who did not like being in the middle of his brothers. In fact, his selfishness was a big story line on the Fox series, as was his disdain for being placed in gifted classes.</p><p>In addition to Malcolm, the Wilkerson squad consisted of two older brothers — Francis Wilkerson (<strong>Christopher Masterson</strong>) and Reese Wilkerson (<strong>Justin Berfield</strong>) — and the baby, Dewey Wilkerson (<strong>Erik Per Sullivan</strong>). <a href=#>Cloris Leachman</a> rounded out the cast as grandma Ida.</p><p>Throughout the sitcom, the Wilkerson boys got into their fair share of trouble. The edgy eldest child, Francis, was often to blame for the drama in the house before he was shipped off to military school.</p><p>While Reese, on the other hand, was known as the fighter in the group — who despite battling his own siblings from time to time — always had their backs against bullies. Dewey was the closest to Malcolm when it came to smarts, but as the baby, he often found himself being the butt of all the boys’ jokes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>More than a decade after Malcolm in the Middle came to an end, the Wilkerson family is still on the minds of many of the show’s diehard fans.</p><p>Luckily, some of the cast has continued to act and stay in the spotlight over the years.
