Boo, whose real name was Lola Mitchell, was discovered dead on Sunday afternoon at about 4 p.m. Her death’s cause hasn’t been made public.</p><p>Boo, a hip-hop artist who came out of the Dirty South school in the 1990s, was the vivacious Memphis equivalent to rappers Eve from Philadelphia, Lil’ Kim from Brooklyn, and Trina from Miami.</p><p>Boo’s career began with a well-known local gang, Three 6 Mafia, created by <a href=# rel=noopener>DJ Paul,</a> Juicy J, and Lord Infamous, and with which she collaborated on several studio albums before leaving in 2002. But in addition to a successful solo career that began with 1998’s “Enquiring Minds” and its first single, “Where Dem Dollas At,” Boo also appeared as a guest on songs by several other artists, including Blood Orange, Latto, Gucci Mane, Run the Jewels, OutKast, Lil Wayne, Eminem, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gangsta-Boo-Dies-2.jpg><p><strong>Boo started rapping while she was a young adolescent. She was born on August 7, 1979,</strong> in the Whitehaven section of Memphis, Tennessee. Boo joined Three 6 Mafia in 1991, and she was a vital member of the group when they recorded their debut album, “Mystic Stylez,” in 1995.</p><p>“Being in Three 6 Mafia did give me a lot of confidence,” <strong>Gangsta Boo told Vibe in 2016.</strong> “I started noticing that not only am I hot but that I’m talented… But you’d be surprised how many motherfuckers don’t know I was in Three 6 Mafia.”</p><p><strong>Do check out more related articles:</strong></p><p>Gangsta Boo remained a member of Three 6 Mafia through 2001’s “<a href=# rel=noopener>Choices: The Album.</a>” Still, she left the hip-hop group in 2002 to focus entirely on her solo career, just a few years after T6M achieved platinum success with its “Most Known Unknown” album and won the 2006 Academy Award for a best original song with “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp” from the movie “Hustle & Flow.”</p><p>In addition to releasing solo albums like “Both Worlds *69” (2001), “Enquiring Minds II: The Soap Opera” (2003), and “The Memphis Queen Is Back” (2007), as well as mixtapes like “It’s Game Involved” (2013) and “Candy, Diamonds & Pills” (2016), Boo made her mark by contributing her snarky raps and tense flow to other musicians. Gangsta Boo contributed vocals to OutKast’s “Stankonia” album from 2000 and Foxy Brown’s “Chyna Doll” album from 1999 before leaving Three 6 Mafia. After 2002, Gangsta Boo released feature verses on Lil Jon’s “Crunk Juice” (2004), Yelawolf’s “Radioactive” album in collaboration with Eminem on “Throw It Up” (2011), the Jeezy/T.I./Lil Wayne trio’s “Prime Time Players” (2013) album, and Run the Jewels’ “Walking in the Snow” from “RTJ4” (2020).</p><p>Boo and her boyfriend Emmet Flores appeared on WEtv’s “Marriage Boot Camp: The Hip Hop Edition” in 2022. She and GloRilla collaborated with Latto on the song “Fuck the Club Up” (commonly known as “FTCU”) in December; the music video for the song was just made public two weeks ago.</p><p>Rappers paid tribute to Boo on social media, and DJ Paul tweeted a picture of her DJing without adding any captions. Several other rappers responded to the post on Paul’s Instagram, including 2 Chainz, Ty Dolla $ign, Ludacris, Big Boi of Outkast, B-Real of Cypress Hill, and Lil Jon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Juicy J also posted a photo of him with Boo, captioning the image with a broken heart emoji.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>💔 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NN3S3SvfBE</a></p><p>— juicy j (@therealjuicyj) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 2, 2023</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=0.23809523809524><p><strong>Do check out more related articles:</strong></p></figure><p><strong>Final lines</strong></p><p>It is strongly recommended that you maintain an active connection to the website<strong> <a class=ab-item href=# rel=noopener aria-haspopup=true>venturejolt.com</a> </strong>if you are interested in accumulating more knowledge on the facts presented in the previous paragraph.
